# hello-world
I'm learning how to do git hub now. Yay!
I am the dad of two awesome little boys named Sam and Oliver, and the husband of a wonderful woman named Margaret. I word for the state of Minnesota, doing research and data analysis on public assistance programs. I love punk music. I love learning new stats coding languages. I like to bike and go climbing. I love to travel.
